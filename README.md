# Fekete polynomials
Here are the Python codes that I wrote to compute and do experiments with Fekete polynomials. These codes have been particularly very helpful in discovering some new inequalities. Our final results published in the article "Fekete polynomials, quadratic residues, and arithmetic" (joint with Jan Minac and Nguyen Duy Tan).
